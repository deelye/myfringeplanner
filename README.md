## Why we made it

Every August, Edinburgh plays host to the magnificent Fringe, the worldâ€™s largest arts and culture festival and most ticketed event after the Olympic Games! 1000s of shows are performed around the clock, ranging from comedy to cabaret, circus, theatre, dance and more!

You are thoroughly spoilt for choice but the flip side is the Herculean effort that goes into planning your festival. Fringe-goers are known to painstakingly construct monstrous, heavily formatted spreadsheets that scroll for miles with dozens of shortlisted shows and puzzle-pieced schedules!

Like most Fringe shows, myfringeplanner is still a WIP, but we'll be fully live with even more features soon...
