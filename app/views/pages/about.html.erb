        <p>Ex-investment banker thinking about extending my obsessive, slightly sadistic enjoyment of the puzzle-solving nature of programming and carving out a new career in the world of coding. Not leaning towards any particular language, application or industry at the moment but the dream would be to work freelance from home or somewhere with a bring-your-dog-to-work policy!</p>

        <p>I'm a recent college grad who worked as a freelance Content Creator. I want to learn code so that I can implement what I write and learn how to do front end development. After the program, I hope to get a job as a junior developer in Norway.</p>
